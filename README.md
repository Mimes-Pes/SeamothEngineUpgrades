# SeamothEngineUpgrades

It is a Seamoth piloting upgrade mod, the upgrade is unlocked with Base Upgrade Console. Making this upgrade requires
- Computer Chip,
- Advanced Wiring Kit and
- Gold.
It is a mod which improves dashboard and adds gears to Seamoth (approx.):
- Gear 1 = forward force 2.5,
- 2 = forward force 6,
- 3 = forward force 9.5,
- 4 = vanilla forward force 13,
- 5 = forward force 16.5,
- 6 = forward force 20,
Energy Use Adjustment:
- Gear 1 = 0.1 of normal,
- 2 = 0.3 of normal,
- 3 = 0.7 of normal,
- 4 = normal usage,
- 5 = 4 x usage,
- 6 = 10 x usage.
Reasoning behind slow speed is to facilitate nice approaches to bases etc.
Extra gear state (1-6) info is implemented, and it shows bottom RHS just above Health, Charge and Temp panel. It shows which gear is Seamoth currently in. Mod has extensive customisation options.
